          Nigeria (/naɪˈdʒɪəriə/ Listen ny-JEER-ee-ə),[a] officially the Federal
          Republic of Nigeria, is a country in West Africa. It is situated
          between the Sahel to the north and the Gulf of Guinea to the south in
          the Atlantic Ocean. It covers an area of 923,769 square kilometres
          (356,669 sq mi), and with a population of over 230 million, it is the
          most populous country in Africa, and the world's sixth-most populous
          country. Nigeria borders Niger in the north, Chad in the northeast,
          Cameroon in the east, and Benin in the west. Nigeria is a federal
          republic comprising 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, where
          the capital, Abuja, is located. The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos,
          one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and the largest in
          Africa.

          Nigeria has been home to several indigenous pre-colonial states and
          kingdoms since the second millennium BC, with the Nok civilization in
          the 15th century BC marking the first internal unification in the
          country. The modern state originated with British colonialization in
          the 19th century, taking its present territorial shape with the
          merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria
          Protectorate in 1914 by Lord Lugard. The British set up administrative
          and legal structures while practising indirect rule through
          traditional chiefdoms in the Nigeria region.[9] Nigeria became a
          formally independent federation on 1 October 1960. It experienced a
          civil war from 1967 to 1970, followed by a succession of military
          dictatorships and democratically elected civilian governments until
          achieving a stable democracy in the 1999 presidential election. The
          2015 general election was the first time an incumbent president failed
          to be re-elected.[10]

        <h2>Die Geschichte</h2>

        <p>
          Kainji Dam excavations showed ironworking by the 2nd century BC. The
          transition from Neolithic times to the Iron Age was accomplished
          without intermediate bronze production. Others believe or suggest the
          technology moved west from the Nile Valley, although the Iron Age in
          the Niger River valley and the forest region appears to predate the
          introduction of metallurgy in the upper savanna by more than 800
          years. The Nok civilization of Nigeria thrived between 1,500 BC and AD
          200. It produced life-sized terracotta figures that are some of the
          earliest known sculptures in Sub-Saharan Africa[25][26][27][28][29]
          and smelted iron by about 550 BC and possibly a few centuries
          earlier.[30][31][32] Evidence of iron smelting has also been excavated
          at sites in the Nsukka region of southeast Nigeria: dating to 2000 BC
          at the site of Lejja[33] and to 750 BC and at the site of Opi.

          The Kano Chronicle highlights an ancient history dating to around 999
          AD of the Hausa Sahelian city-state of Kano, with other major Hausa
          cities (or Hausa Bakwai) of Daura, Hadeija, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau,
          Rano, and Gobir all having recorded histories dating back to the 10th
          century. With the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD, the area
          became known as Sudan or as Bilad Al Sudan (English: Land of the
          Blacks; Arabic: بلاد السودان). Since the populations were partially
          affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of North Africa, they began
          trans-Saharan trade and were referred to by the Arabic speakers as
          Al-Sudan (meaning "The Blacks") as they were considered an extended
          part of the Muslim world. There are early historical references by
          medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers which refer to the
          Kanem-Bornu Empire as the region's major centre for Islamic
          civilization.

          Britain intervened in the Lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding
          Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave-trade-friendly Oba Kosoko, helping
          to install the amenable Oba Akitoye and signing the Treaty between
          Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a
          crown colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British
          missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.
          In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the
          Anglican Church.[46]
